# noise patterns

Project features animations made with the help of multidimentional simplex noise functions. Three.js shaders along with "glsl-noise" package are used for calculating and visualizing noise. 

Inspired by an [article](https://thebookofshaders.com/11/) on noise functions in [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com) 
and a set of articles on [Codrops](https://tympanus.net/codrops/) such as [this one](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2019/10/23/making-gooey-image-hover-effects-with-three-js/).
